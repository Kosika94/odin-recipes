    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This special stew is the meal our two kids look forward to each fall because we only get to enjoy it when the fresh pumpkins come out of the garden.</p>
    <p>The stew is cooked and served right in the pumpkin shell. A true taste of autumn, it also makes a pretty presentation at a potluck</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 medium carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large green pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules</li>
        <li>1 can (14-1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 pumpkin (10 to 12 pounds)</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, brown meat in 2 tablespoons oil. Add water, potatoes, carrots, green pepper, garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Stir in bouillon and tomatoes. Wash pumpkin; cut a 6 to 8 in. circle around top stem. Remove top and set aside; discard seeds and loosen fibers from inside.</li>
        <li>Place pumpkin in a shallow sturdy baking pan. Spoon stew into pumpkin and replace top. Brush outside of pumpkin with remaining oil. Bake at 325Â° for 2 hours or just until the pumpkin is tender (do not overbake). Serve stew from pumpkin, scooping out a little pumpkin with each serving.</li>
    </ol>
